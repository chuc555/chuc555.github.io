            <p>Luck relates only to events that depend on pure chance or whose cause, not depending on ourselves, can and could have turned out contrary to our wishes, without our having any cause to complain.</p>

        <p>luck is out of our control; </p>
        <p>you cannot make yourself lucky; </p>
        <p> you either are or you are not.</p>

        <p>A man who enjoys an honest fortune could choose to play or not to play odds and evens, but all his personal qualities would not bring him better luck</p>
